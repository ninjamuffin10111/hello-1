# Not Yo Grandma's Hello World

No offense to anyone's dear grandmother let's do the traditional hello
world with some real professional flare. Depending on how much
programming you have done this might take you longer than you might
expect, but it will be worth it. This version of the age-old *Hello
World* program covers much more than most and introduces the main
concepts and syntax of procedural programming (variables, data
types, strings, numbers, booleans, lists/arrays, dictionaries/maps,
operators, loops, logic, conditionals, blocks, functions, exceptions,
math, command line arguments, code organization, and more).

## Planning

This is the first Fundamentals project we do at SkilStak beginning
with [Python](py), then [JavaScript](js), and then [HTML](html).
Other Core courses do it as well in [Go](go), [Java](java), [C](c),
[Shell](shell).
