# Not Yo Grandma's Hello World

No offense to anyone's dear grandmother let's do the traditional hello
world with some real professional flare. Depending on how much
programming you have done this might take you longer than you might
expect, but it will be worth it. 

*Hello World* is a traditional program created anytime someone wants
to demonstrate or test everything needed to get a basic program to
run or to show the basics of what that program looks like. But we
say, why not show all the fundamental procedural programming concepts
of the language?  Most languages have variables, data types, strings,
numbers, booleans, lists/arrays, dictionaries/maps, operators,
loops, logic, conditionals, blocks, functions, exceptions, math,
command line arguments, and modules/packages. This version of *hello
world* let's you compare them all.

## But First ...

Make sure you have the [Code and Prepâ„¢](http://github.com/skilstak/prep)
skills mastered before attempting this one.  This is the first
Fundamentals project we do at SkilStak beginning with [Python](py),
then [JavaScript](js), and then [HTML](html).  Other Core courses
do it as well in [Go](go), [Java](java), [C](c), [Shell](shell), even
[LolCode](lol).

***Note: Make sure you start with [Python](py) since it covers things like
creating your first script file, permissions and such.***
