# Not Yo Grandma's Hello World

We mean no offense to anyone's dear grandmother, but if Granny was
a programmer then she'd have a word or two to say about *this*
version of hello world. 

## Your First Program

*Hello World* is a traditional program created anytime someone wants
to demonstrate or test everything needed to get a basic program to
run or to show the basics of what that program looks like. It is
usually the simplest program that can be written in the language,
and has been written in [dozens if not hundreds of programming
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hello_world_program_examples).
But why not show all the fundamental programming concepts of the
language as well?  All modern languages have variables, data types,
strings, numbers, booleans, lists/arrays, dictionaries/maps,
operators, loops, logic, conditionals, blocks, functions,
errors/exceptions, math, command line arguments, and modules/packages.
This unusual version of *hello world* helps you learn and compare
them all and hopefully will give students something significant to
show the comprehensive programming skills they have learned and not
just the `print()` function.

Depending on how much programming you have done this might take you
longer than you might expect, but it will be worth it. Don't worry.
You can finish the first part in under two minutes (if you can
actually type that is).

## But First ...

Make sure you have the [Code and Prepâ„¢](http://github.com/skilstak/prep)
skills mastered before attempting this one.  This is the first
Fundamentals project we do at SkilStak beginning with [Python](py),
then [JavaScript](js), and then [HTML](html), (which everyone knows
isn't a programming language, but still important to learn early).
Other Core courses do it as well in [Go](go), [Java](java), [C](c),
[Shell](shell), even [LolCode](lol). [And if it can't be coded from
the command line it's an irrelevant language anyway that you shouldn't 
waste any time on.]

***Note: Make sure you start with [Python](py) since it covers things like
creating your first script file, permissions and such.***
