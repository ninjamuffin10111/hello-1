# Not Yo Grandma's Hello World

This is the first Fundamentals project we do at SkilStak beginning
with [Python](py), then [JavaScript](js), and then [HTML](html).
Other Core courses do it as well in [Go](go), [Java](java), [C](c),
[Shell](shell), even [LolCode](lol).

## Concepts

This version of the age-old *Hello World* program covers much more
than most and introduces the main concepts and syntax of procedural
programming (variables, strings, numbers, lists/arrays, dictionaries/maps,
operators, logic, conditionals, functions, math, command line
arguments, and more).
