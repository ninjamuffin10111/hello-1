# python

The best first programming language to learn as taught at MIT and
elsewhere. Historically Python has been hated by some for its
white-space significant form (no brackets, just indents for code
blocks). Python came out around the time of PHP and Perl in the 90s
and has since become the dominant winner and survivor among modern
scripting languages.
